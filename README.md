###3D World

• The world consists of an ocean that stretches to infinity.
• You are the captain of a ship and have to roam around this ocean.
• There are enemy pirate ships that can attack you, and you may attack them as well.
• You collect treasure chests floating around on the water surface.

###Ships
• There are 2 kinds of ships - your own ship and the enemy ships.
• Your ship can move on the surface of the water freely using the WASD keys.
• Both kinds of ships can shoot each other with cannon balls.
• The enemy ships randomly spawn and then approach towards the main ship to destroy it.
• You have to destroy the enemy ships while the enemy ships attempt to destroy you with cannon balls.
• There is a scoring system - indicating the number of kills you have, the number of times you have been killed, and the number of chests you have collected.


### Treasure Chest
• There are golden treasure chests that spawn across the ocean, and respawn everytime they are collected.
• These chests have to be collected upon collision.
• The more chests you collect, you score goes higher.


### Different Camera Views
The gamer has the option of toggling between several camera views by utilizing the  0 and 1 keys.
There are two main views:
• A top bird’s eye view.
